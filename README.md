The equestrian database I created is a specialized system designed to manage various aspects of equestrian activities, focusing on horse management, barn logistics, financial transactions, and show scheduling. This comprehensive database not only tracks key details about horses, barns, and shows but also integrates functionalities to manage and schedule horses for various events. ![image](https://github.com/lpiedrahitas/equestrian-database/assets/152738102/e3350f87-3570-4e88-8de9-cd0e620fca88)
